                <p>Modern U.S. craft beer history began in the 1960s. You may know part of the story, the increasing popularity of homebrewing beer in the 1970s and the rise of microbreweries in the 1990s. The sheer number of beer styles that make up the craft beer scene is exciting, but it can also be intimidating, and thatâ€™s okay!<br /><br /></p>
                <p>With all of the different beer name and styles, it may be tough to remember what differentiates beers from one another. At KraftBier.com, we have compiled a collection of craft beers that have been favorites over the years, and have made it available direct to you, straight from the brewers themselves.</p>
